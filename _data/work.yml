      Chicago’s pioneering but antique 311, one of the largest non-emergency systems in the nation, handled millions of requests annually, but the world was a very different place in 1999. The system was straining at the seams, with hundreds of service request types, but only a few dozen available electronically via SMS or a web lookup created by Code for America in 2013. Most calls didn't need an operator, but people had to call, potentially taking 311 operator support away from 911 and, ultimately, officers off the street.

      The 311 Modernization program is a series of digital transformation projects to move an analog workflow to a full-service constituent platform with a digital workflow for 40,000 City of Chicago employees across 33 departments and thousands of service request types.

      It was my job to use user experience and service design methods to include resident voice in the product design process.

        caption: Through interviews with employees and the public we created a model for service delivery, then design and managed a dozen participatory design workshops with hundreds of constituents in libraries across the City, accompanied City service workers on the job, and shadowed 311 service operators to find opportunities to unlock innovation.

      In December 2018, we launched the new CHI 311 platform to residents and staff, which includes the City’s first ever mobile app.
      The new system allows residents to create new service requests, upload pictures, follow requests, and receive completion time estimates and other status updates via app, web, phone or SMS. Facebook messenger coming in 2020.

      We tested early versions of the new 311 system with residents at libraries and community colleges across the city and made refinements based on their feedback in 15 testing sessions with over 350 community testers thanks to the help of Chicago sister agencies. Through partnership with DePaul University's College of Digital Media, we have organized student volunteer usability testing resulting in bug improvements and feature requests driven by the community.

  learnings:
    description: |
      * Net Promoter Scores are meaningless.
      * No consistent standards meant it was difficult to give guidance early. Instead of going on a treasure hunt, think laterally.
      * Whomever owns the means of production controls the experience. Make nice and be pushy for your community.
      * Governments are not set up to encourage outcome driven behavior like a business, product startup or a political campaign.
      * Don't mess with the Water Department.

      * Over 200 service request types online, with the top 80 available via mobile app.
      * 50k+ mobile application downloads of our first mobile app.

      Living with over 500 logos, 200 applications, and no design standards is a recipe for confusing messaging delivered inconsistently at great expense. Our new design system saves money and time while supporting accessible, inclusive, consistent communication.

      While working on 311, we realized there were many style guides and accessibility policies, but nearly no one followed them. Great services went under-utilized and unknown.

      A design system would help, but we also knew from our experience designing 311 that we needed outside expertise to help us tell our story best. In consultation and partnership with the Mayor's Office, we realized we needed additional expertise to shape the city's public identity, so we partnered with Ogilvy, Google, and House of Pretty on a pro bono project to design a new identity for Chicago.
  research:
    description: |
      We began by reviewing the City's major technology programs, departments, and service delivery channels to understand what was in market and what design language it used to communicate. Along with inventorying our current state, we examined the branding efforts of other global cities to understand the benefits and pitfalls of different approaches. Finally, we examined the history and origin of Chicago's civic heraldry and neighborhood devices to place our work in the larger historical context, including interviews with the City's historian.

      The Chicago Design System is the public visual identity of the City of Chicago. It is an inclusive, equitable, cost saving system for City communication and for the public to use to show civic pride.

      We validated the brand by sharing it publicly for comment in the fall of 2019. We received positive and critical feedback on accessibility and usage that helped us evolve the framework. We also piloted web projects with the system throughout 2019 with community users, university graduate students, and business partners to understand the barriers to adoption.
  learnings:
    description: |
      We learned early on that that City didn't have a uniform marketing voice because it was no one's responsibility to enforce it.

      In 2018 I fielded 37 outside project requests from different departments during the course of the 311 Modernization launch. It became apparent fast that the scale of procurement, systems, relationships, and politics were the study of many lifetimes. Often, the only help I could offer was to describe what the process would look like, and in a few cases, offer a service or two. It was small comfort that wasn't helping anyone.

      I knew coming into the job that part of the work was establishing the practice, but the combination of a low budget, no hiring, an inspector general process audit and other challenges made the going tough. Each win offered the possibility of impacting service delivery for a community of Chicagoans, making government more transparent and efficient.
  research:
    description: |
      My initial research consisted of learning in three tracks: using Leah Buley's UX project profiler to understand incoming work and teams, ad hoc design facilitation and strategy workshop services as requested, and a listening tour with internal stakeholders across departments and technology vendor UX/UI teams about their methods, skills, process, and goals.  
  solution:

      I categorize our design operations work as follows:
      #### Culture
      Introduce and enforce adoption of human-centered design methods, systems thinking and design thinking to produce better products with less risk and cost. Create culture change through internal education, exposure to collaborative opportunities with Chicagoans, designers and design programs with a focus on introducing design skills and fostering collaboration.
      #### Process
      Responsible for establishing design standards that incorporate resident engagement, co-creation, prototyping, and validation.
      #### Product
      Support project teams through the performance of design duties or through design direction and planning with vendor design teams, university design departments, and philanthropic teams.
