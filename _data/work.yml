      No definition of design standards enforced across departments or teams, leading to over 500 logos under management and over 200 applications with inconsistent, outdated standards, and money wasted defining and solving the same issues, over and over again.

      I began by reviewing the City's major technology programs, departments, and service delivery channels to understand what was in market and what design language it used to communicate. Along with inventorying our current state, we examined the branding efforts of other global cities to understand the benefits and pitfalls of different approaches. Finally, we examined the history and origin of Chicago's civic heraldry and neighborhood devices to place our work in the larger historical context, including interviews with the City's historian.
      Comparative analysis, interface inventory, listening tour.

      After creating the 311 logo, we realized we needed additional expertise to shape the city's public identity. We pitched Ogilvy to help us on a pro bono basis, and they accepted.

      We validated the brand by sharing it publicly for comment in the fall of 2019. We received positive and critical feedback on accessibility and usage that helped us evolve the framework. We also piloted web projects with the system throughout 2019 with community users, university graduate students, and business partners to understand the barriers to adoption.
