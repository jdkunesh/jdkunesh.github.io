          No definition of design standards enforced across departments or teams, leading to over 500 logos under management and over 200 applications with inconsistent, outdated standards, and money wasted defining and solving the same issues, over and over again. The piecemeal approach led to inaccessible, poorly translated systems, ugly systems not befitting the 3rd largest City in America. Mayor Rahm Emmanuel hated our dated digital brand.

          I began by reviewing the City's major technology programs, departments, and service delivery channels to understand what was in market and what design language it used to communicate. Along with inventorying our current state, we examined the branding efforts of other global cities to understand the benefits and pitfalls of different approaches. Finally, we examined the history and origin of Chicago's civic heraldry and neighborhood devices to place our work in the larger historical context, including interviews with the City's historian.

    Public Good is an AI for Good platform that makes news actionable for brands and nonprofits. I co-founded Public Good as one of the first social benefit startups to continue the work we began at Obama for America.
    * Raised $3mm in venture funding to build a capacity building startup. We served thousands of customers and helped them raise millions of dollars, but couldn't scale. We pivoted the business to solve the unsolved problem we kept hearing: when people read the news they want to take action but don't know how.
    * Billions of minds changes through our Public Good for Media program.
    * Did lots of advisory activities from future of work to future of design.
