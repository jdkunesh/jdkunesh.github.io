      Living with over 500 logos, 200 applications, and no design standards makes for confusing messaging delivered inconsistently at great expense. Our new design system saves money and time while supporting accessible and inclusive  The piecemeal approach led to inaccessible, poorly translated and, frankly, ugly systems. 
 
      After creating the 311 logo, we realized we needed additional expertise to shape the city's public identity, so we partnered with Ogilvy on a pro bono project to design a new identity for Chicago.
  research:
    description: |
      We began by reviewing the City's major technology programs, departments, and service delivery channels to understand what was in market and what design language it used to communicate. Along with inventorying our current state, we examined the branding efforts of other global cities to understand the benefits and pitfalls of different approaches. Finally, we examined the history and origin of Chicago's civic heraldry and neighborhood devices to place our work in the larger historical context, including interviews with the City's historian.

      We validated the brand by sharing it publicly for comment in the fall of 2019. We received positive and critical feedback on accessibility and usage that helped us evolve the framework. We also piloted web projects with the system throughout 2019 with community users, university graduate students, and business partners to understand the barriers to adoption.
