WORK EXPERIENCE
===============

*City of Chicago, Department of Assets Information & Services, Bureau of Information Technology - Chicago, IL (110 employees)*  
The Department of Assets, Information and Services (AIS) supports the operations of other City Departments by providing high-quality and cost-effective services as a result of the consolidation of the Department of Fleet and Facility Management (2FM) with the Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT). The newly minted Bureau of Information Technology supports city-wide technology infrastructure, from network topography and smart street lighting to data science, 311 city services, chicago.gov websites, social platforms, cellphones, computers and other hardware for city personnel and facilities.

Design Director - 01/2018 to Present (Hours per week: 40)  
The City of Chicago created the Design Director position to ensure the 311 modernization project included community engagement, user experience, and design thinking as part of the delivery process in a multiyear engagement. In addition, the role would define user experience design methods, processes, and roles, determine design standards for City staff and technology vendors, and work with agencies and partners to improve the readability, usability, language access, and accessibility of City of Chicago digital services. As the first Design Director there was no existing staff or budget, leading to multiple collaobrations with local educational and professional insitutions to accelerate the impact of human-centered design and agile software delivery methods.

In March 2020 with the advent of COVID-19, tasked with leading our software development team and vendor partner supporting chicago.gov, 80 web applications, and all our COVID19 web-based digital response work. Functionally the role is product management with less autonomy and a diverse remit, working with internal partners in the Mayor's Office, Department of Public Health, public safety and communications personnel as well as external agencies, consultancies, nonprofit and community partners on public health messaging and digital communications in a pandemic.

Highlighted work:

* The Public Mark of Chicago (https://design.chicago.gov/public-mark) is our first new symbol in over a century, built for the public to celebrate community spirit. Living with over 500 logos, 200 applications, and no design standards is a recipe for confusing messaging delivered inconsistently at great expense. Our new mark, along with our new design system, saves the City money and time while supporting accessible, inclusive, consistent communication. Through grit and patience an unlikely April 2018 pro bono pitch meeting arranged by Mayor Rahm Emanuel's team transformed into a successful launch under Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Chicago's birthday - March 4th, 2020. Led the project without budget through a leadership transition by utilizing Northwestern and DePaul University classes, interns, volunteers, and Google to build upon the work of 18F, then acquired sponsorship required for launch. Through projects like a fork of the original USWDS at https://github.com/Chicago/design-cds-jekyll, we were able to research, build, design, and code https://design.chicago.gov, the launch site for our new design system. Please review https://design.chicago.gov/2019/09/23/why-the-chicago-design-system.html for additional details.
* Responsible for defining and leading user experience practices within the City of Chicago, and their application on the 311 Modernization project, including maintaining our public 311 roadmap in Trello, creating protocols, reviewing wireframes, and facilitating internal roadmap prioritization for 311 community portal and mobile applications. Engaged volunteers from DePaul University for ad hoc usability testing. 
* Re-wrote our master consulting agreement to require human centered practices and adherence to WCAG 2.0 AA within our procurement process. 
* To educate leadership on our digital service team needs, wrote a planning memo for how the City of Chicago could achieve compliance with our own readability, usability, language access and accessibility policies (https://design.chicago.gov/2019/08/23/a-plan-for-rula.html) as well as a series of internal memos explaining digital services and the role product managers play in a build-measure-learn Agile process. 
* With the retirement of our Software Development IT Director, I am now responsible for chicago.gov, chicago.gov/COVID19, and a host of other applications, as well as for the implementation of the technologies supporting these digital services. A brief review of chicago.gov will show a website organized by department, linking immediately to a patchwork of disparate transactional sites, all with poor translation. Despite a pandemic, we have produced a new Chicago Design System in Bootstrap 4 (http://github.com/Chicago/design-cds-bootstrap) and implemented it in Adobe Experience Manager, our content management system. It is in use at chicago.gov/COVID19. In addition, we acquired the support of Slalom Consulting, whom we engaged with in a quick content reorganization in partnership with technical staff, the community, and our domain experts in Public Health.
* Worked with the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities to obtain accessible content certification training for our top 50 content managers, form relationships with community organizations for ad hoc accessibility feedback, and implemented a manual set of a11y checks using tools like WAVE, WebAim, and pa11y.
* Facilitated team-building exercises to review the principles of leading digital service teams, and reconsider our own. We created new design principles for our team, found at https://design.chicago.gov/principles/
* We are primarily a Microsoft organization so our team uses Microsoft Teams, Sharepoint, and the Office Suite (Word, Powerpoint, Excel) to track work and communicate with internal and external stakeholders.
* We use Figma for prototyping and design collaboration with internal and external partners, and have bi-weekly team hangouts to discuss tips and tricks. Our design system is available as a Sticker Sheet at http://figma.com/@chicago, derived from an 18F Sketch file import, then rebuild and redesign by DePaul students, interns and me. This work was featured at Config, Figma's first design conference, in February, 2020.
