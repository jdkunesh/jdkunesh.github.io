I am the Design Director for the City of Chicago, making the City work better for residents, visitors, and businesses by building awareness and usage of digital information and services designed with the community like [311](https://311.chicago.gov/) and the [Chicago Design System](https://chicagodesignsystem.org/).

I am the first person in this role. I have had the privilege of saying that pretty often in my career as I've progressed from programming to design to product leadership. I have worked in all sorts of market sectors with acronyms like B2B/B2C/G2B/G2C/B2G/C2G and C2C Whew, I think that's all of 'em, often on either side of the table. Most of the time it's worked out pretty great.

I am the former CEO and Board Chair of [Public Good Software](https://publicgood.com/), one of (if not the very first) social enterprise software startups in Chicago. Prior to that, I was the first Director of User Experience & Product on a presidential campaign at [Obama for America](https://barackobama.com/). Before that I founded and led [Fuzzy Math](https://fuzzymath.com), a user experience design shop in Chicago, after leaving ThePoint.com, one of the first collective action platforms. It grew up to be [Groupon](https://groupon.com).

I was an early team member at [Orbitz](https://www.orbitz.com), one of the first travel websites, where we pioneered business travel online. I kicked around Web 1.0 & 2.0 as a consultant, and have had stints in academia as an adjunct faculty member at [DePaul University](http://cdm.depaul.edu) and the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago](http://www.saic.edu/t4/front/).

I've played [Metro's main stage](https://metrochicago.com) a couple times as well as assorted dive bars around the greater Midwest. I was a bouncer at the [Green Mill](http://greenmilljazz.com), so settle down, please. You'll have a better time if you don't make A scene, but make THE scene, y'know?

I've been been fortunate to consult or work with awesome organizations from A to Z including: 3M, American Airlines, the Chicago Field Museum, the Clinton Foundation, the Dali Lama Center, Edelman, Emory University, Fellowes Manufacturing, GE Healthcare, Giant Bike, The Grammy Foundation, IBM, Intel, Jabber, LeapFrog, Lockheed Martin, the Mayo Clinic, McDonald's, Microsoft, the NFL, NORC at the University of Chicago, New York Presbyterian Hospital, SAP Fieldglass, Simon Properties, Threadless, United Airlines, UX for Good, Walt Disney Corporation, and bunches more you've never heard of. I am an advisor to [Designation](https://designation.io/), [Greenhouse: the Center of Social Innovation](https://www.ghouseinnovation.com), and [Side Door](https://www.sidedooraccess.com).

I'm open to growth, product, and design roles as a speaker, advisor, or team member. I'm interested in using growth and design skills to transform customers and grow positive brands and products at scale with a focus on growth, internationalization, inclusion, and accessibility.
