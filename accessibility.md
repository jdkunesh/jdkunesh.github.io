I am committed to making information and services accessible to people through {{ site.name }}. I strive to provide a welcoming and helpful experience.

## What are we doing?

To help make {{ site.name }} a positive place for everyone, I follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.

The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for {{ site.name }}.

## How are we doing?

I believe this website to be WCAG AA accessible, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.
