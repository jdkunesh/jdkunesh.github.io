title: Colophon

---

A colophon typically describes the methods, tools, and materials used to make a creative work. Traditionally, colophons were the ending flourish of a book. This is the colophon for this site, {{ site.name }}.

## History

Some version of this site has been online since 1995. It has changed greatly over time. This version of the site was produced in December, 2019. Highlights of the new version include wholly new content, including an updated portfolio, as well as administrivia (like this colophon) and important features (like [accessibility](/accessibility)).

## Technology

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is produced using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a blog-aware static site generator written in Ruby. Jekyll can generate a static web site from text content stored in markdown files and a theme, in this case a rudimentary custom theme.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
